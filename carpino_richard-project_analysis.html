			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<h3>Current Site:</h3>
			<p>The Spring Lake Elementary website currently features an unorganized theme that creates a less than desirable user experience. The navigation contains twenty-one links not including an unnecessary link for the current page right below that when clicked will just take you to the page you are already viewing.  Tables and poor use of heading tags and non-semantically written html is the norm on every page it seems, the site does not validate correctly using the W3.org validator.</p>
			<h3>Project Goal:</h3>
			<p>The new Spring Lake Elementary website will feature a new streamlined theme with updated navigation menu. The current menu has many categories, most which can be combined into the same page, which with fewer categories will make the user experience less confusing and more enjoyable. Code will be semantically written with Web Standards in mind to ensure proper utilization of bandwidth so pages will load optimally.</p>
